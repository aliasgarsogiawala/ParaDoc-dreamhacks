# ParaDoc

## A Parallel Reality Simulation for Medical Decision-Making

ParaDoc is an innovative healthcare application that simulates multiple "what-if" futures based on your current health choices. Like exploring a multiverse of preventative care, ParaDoc helps users visualize potential outcomes of different medical decisions.

<!-- ![ParaDoc Banner](https://placeholder-for-banner-image.com) -->

## üß† The Concept

Think of ParaDoc as answering questions like:
- "What would happen if I ignore this pain for 2 weeks?"
- "What if I go to the clinic today?" 
- "Should I try home remedies or seek medical attention?"

By leveraging advanced AI, ParaDoc creates parallel timelines showing the potential progression of symptoms and outcomes, helping you make more informed healthcare decisions today.

## üîç Features

### üîÄ Multi-Path Simulator
- AI-powered generation of three possible outcome paths based on your symptoms
- See what might happen if you do nothing, seek medical attention, or self-medicate

### üìä Timeline Visualizer
- Day 1 ‚Üí Day 7 outcome visualization for each decision path
- Track the progression of symptoms and consequences over time

### üß† Risk & Recovery Assessment
- Each decision path is rated with risk percentage and recovery percentage
- Visual indicators help quickly identify the safest options

### üó£ Explainer Bot
- Detailed explanations of why certain paths are better than others
- Evidence-based reasoning like "Because untreated infection often worsens within 72 hours..."

### üñºÔ∏è Visual Health Representations
- AI-generated medical illustrations showing the progression of symptoms
- Visual storytelling to help understand potential health outcomes

## üìã How to Use

1. **Enter your symptoms** - Describe what you're experiencing as specifically as possible
2. **Select a symptom category** (optional) - This helps the AI provide more accurate simulations
3. **Review the timelines** - See how your symptoms might progress under different scenarios
4. **Examine risk scores** - Higher scores mean greater potential health risks
5. **Follow the recommendation** - ParaDoc will suggest the safest course of action

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini with prompt chains for multi-path generation
- **Timeline**: Custom React components for timeline visualization
- **Risk Logic**: AI-based scoring model using symptom severity and progression
